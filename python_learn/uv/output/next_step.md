## Priority Recommendations

For a mid-level Python developer focusing on practical applications:

1. **Start with**: The current basic_usage.py script to understand fundamentals
2. **Next priority**: advanced_integration.py for real-world scenarios
3. **Then**: project_templates.py for specific use case patterns
4. **Finally**: migration_guide.md for transitioning existing projects

## Learning Path

1. **Foundation** (Current session): Basic concepts and operations
2. **Practical Application**: Advanced integration patterns
3. **Specialization**: Project-specific templates and workflows
4. **Mastery**: Performance optimization and troubleshooting

## Implementation Notes

- Each example file should be self-contained and executable
- Include comprehensive comments explaining UV-specific concepts
- Provide practical scenarios relevant to mid-level developers
- Focus on real-world applications rather than toy examples
- Include error handling and best practices
- Demonstrate both basic and advanced usage patterns within each file

## Target Audience Considerations

For mid-level Python developers:
- Assume familiarity with pip, virtual environments, and basic Python packaging
- Focus on practical benefits and migration strategies
- Include performance comparisons and benchmarks
- Emphasize productivity improvements and modern workflows
- Provide clear migration paths from existing tools
