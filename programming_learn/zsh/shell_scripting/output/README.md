# Zsh Shell Scripting for Beginners

## Introduction

Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, combine commands, and create reusable programs using the command line. Zsh (Z Shell) is an extended version of the Bash shell with many additional features, making it an excellent choice for both interactive use and scripting.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive guide covers:
- Setting up and executing Zsh scripts
- Variables and data types
- User input and output
- Control flow structures (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and script organization
- Error handling and debugging
- Best practices and common patterns

## Why Zsh for Shell Scripting?

Zsh offers several advantages:
- **Advanced globbing**: More powerful pattern matching
- **Associative arrays**: Key-value data structures
- **Better parameter expansion**: More flexible variable manipulation
- **Improved completion**: Enhanced tab completion
- **Compatibility**: Mostly compatible with Bash scripts
- **Built-in features**: Many utilities built into the shell

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with the command line
- Zsh installed on your system (default on macOS Catalina+)
- A text editor for writing scripts

## Getting Started

### Checking Your Zsh Version

```zsh
zsh --version
```

### Setting Zsh as Default Shell (if needed)

```zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Script Structure

A basic Zsh script follows this structure:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
# Script description and purpose
# Author: Your Name
# Date: Creation date

# Script content goes here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### The Shebang Line

The first line `#!/usr/bin/env zsh` tells the system to use Zsh to execute the script. This is called a "shebang" or "hashbang".

## Making Scripts Executable

Before running a script, make it executable:

```zsh
chmod +x myscript.zsh
```

Then run it:

```zsh
./myscript.zsh
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the practical examples in the `examples/` directory
2. Practice with the provided exercises
3. Read about advanced topics in `advanced_features.md`
4. Explore error handling in `error_handling.md`
